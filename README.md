# CouncilRecords
Open Source Project to better view Houston Council member records

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/i7uqiG6M/council-records-app)

# Description:
A powerful search engine to easily view the City of Houston's procurements by search term, date range, and spending range. Accesses public data from [here](http://houston.novusagenda.com/agendapublic/).

During full implementation we would like to expand beyond procurements to ordinances, council member activity, and
board appointments.
